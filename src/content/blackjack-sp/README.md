- **Hit**, **Stand**, and **New round** flow with win, loss, and push outcomes
- **Scores** from visible cards during the deal, then full hands once play starts

## Game rules (implemented)

- Dealer draws while their score is **below 17** (stands on **17+**).
- **Push** returns the bet; a **player win** pays **1:1** on the wager (you receive your bet back plus winnings equal to the bet).
- Starting bank: **100 chips**; minimum bet: **1 chip**.
